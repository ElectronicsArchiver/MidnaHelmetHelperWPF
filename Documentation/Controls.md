Control definitions:

-LOCK/UNLOCK: Locks the popup window to allow you to draw through it

-SHOW/HIDE: Displays the popup window

-PASTE/CLEAR BG: Takes the image data off of your clipboard and makes it the background of the popup. Useful if you want to just screenshot/snip your sketch's head and position the model as a posed reference

-BASE/CUSTOM (Model): Toggle between the fused shadow and a custom .obj file of your choosing

-BACK/NOBACK: will show/hide the backs of polygons in the viewer. This is so that when you have the model posed over Midna's face, the back part isn't blocking your sketch

-BASE/LINE/CUSTOM (Texture): Toggle between the base fused shadow texture, a quick line guide version I made, and your own file

-SAVE SCREENSHOT: Saves a screenshot of the popup window, including any custom pasted background

-HELP PLS: Shows a quick rundown of what the app does in a popup window
